<p>Question 1: The purpose of the various auxiliary methods <code>populateList</code>, <code>populateFifoList</code>, and <code>ReverseLines.printReverse</code> is to use recursion to print out the lines in a desired order.<br>
<br>
Question 2: These methods need arguments because they are being called over and over again. Essentially, java is stacking up elements until something is done with them. They are “waiting” until the method returns.<br>
<br>
Question 3: All the methods are O(n).<br>
<br>
Question 4: <code>populateList</code>, <code>populateFifoList</code>, and <code>ReverseLines.printReverse</code> can all be implemented using a while loop.</p>
